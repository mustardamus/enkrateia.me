## Conclusion

It wasn't too hard, but that could be because I already did some intermittent
fasting in the past. I want to build a habit now out of it. Not fasting
everyday, but to make sure to have a eating window of only 8 hours, which means
at least 16 hours of fasting. 18+ hours will be a bonus point for the habit.

What I realized is that I have trouble controlling late night munchies when I
smoked weed. This will break the 16 hour non-eating cycle, and usually eating
sugar in the middle of the night will do me nothing good. But since I am working
on quitting weed, it is okay.

Also, in the past, I've been eating late without having an eye on the effects.
But it is connected, if I eat late (meal or snack), my sleep is not that good,
and thus the following day I run on low energy. That can result in a downward
spiral of not caring and eating dirty and late again. Make the connection!

Also, what I want to do in the future, is to eat more clean again. In my current
situation food is available for me, but not the best kind. I'll be on my own in
a couple weeks and then start to eat clean again, and probably will do another
month of experimenting.
