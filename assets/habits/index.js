    `,
    how: `
- The “W” stands for a wish or concern. Step back and think about one wish in
  your life that you would like to accomplish.
- “O” is the outcome. Identify the best thing that can be associated with
  fulfilling your wish and imagine the relevant events and experience as vividly
  as possible.
- The second “O” is the obstacle. Find the most critical, internal obstacle that
  prevents you from fulfilling the wish and identify what thoughts or behaviors
  might play a role.
- The “P” stands for the plan. Name one thought or action that can be taken to
  overcome your obstacle and think about when and where the obstacle will next
  occur. ([source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/new-take/201512/the-simple-technique-achieving-your-goals))
