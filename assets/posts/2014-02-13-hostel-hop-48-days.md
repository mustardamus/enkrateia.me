### The idea

Since I've been [homeless the past seven months](/posts/put-yourself-out-there),
I've been in a lot of hostels. And I totally enjoyed it. In fact, so much that I
stayed at the
[Bubble](http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Budapest-Bubble/Budapest/20989)
in Budapest for one month, for example.

Where else could you connect with strangers from all over the world that easily?
And that to different degrees. Some you will never know by name. With some you
have dinner. Some you will get to know for a whole week, or even a month. With
most of them you go out and party.

So I really enjoyed making these social connections. If there would only be a
service to create and manage these connections in our digital world...

Facebook? Yes, that would be the simplest solution. But fortunately I quit
Facebook about a year ago. All I got to exchange was my e-mail address. Or
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/mustardamus). Which was fine for me, but it got me
thinking.

There is so much more to it than making new friends (though that is the best
part). This is what a social platform built around hostels could do:

  - see who is currently in the same hostel as you are
  - plan activities with people who have the same interests
  - chat or message with people within the same hostel
  - connect and exchange your information with people you enjoyed spending time
with
  - get suggestions of places or activities from the hostel staff
  - connect your whole group with other hostels in the same city
  - see who you met, and where
  - probably a lot more...

You get the idea. Instead of 'befriending' with anyone (Facebook), you actually
make real connections with people from all over the world and manage them
digitally.

### The ball is rolling

Last weekend my friend Marko and I were attending the coding contest [Static
Showdown](http://www.staticshowdown.com/). We created a first proof of concept
for Hostel Hop. [Check it out here](http://ss14-team-114.divshot.io/).

You can login and specify things you would like to do. Then, you could check in
to a hostel and see people who are also staying in the same. You can see people
who have the same interests as you have and also find the location of spots
right in the area of the  hostel.

### Now for the real thing

The next 48 days I'll strive to built a functioning first version of Hostel Hop
and document the progress. Also, naturally, I will travel around and speak to
hostel workers as well as visitors about this idea. The ultimate goal would be
funding to move this project forward.

Any feedback is very welcome: Write me a [e-mail](mailto:contact@mustardamus.com)
