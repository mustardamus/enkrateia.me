This was a quick one night stop in Budapest because there is no bus from
Bratislava to Sofia.

Anyway, I arrived at 11PM and instantly felt connected to the city again. On my
last trip I spent one month in Budapest. I loved it.

I instantly did go out and found my way to [Szimpla](http://szimpla.hu/en),
[Corvintetö](http://corvinteto.hu/) and [Fogas
Ház](https://www.facebook.com/fogashaz) - three famous
[ruinpubs](http://ruinpubs.com/).

Nothing too crazy happened, had two beers and talked shit with Swedish guys
tressed up as cats. Typical Monday in 'Pest.

Next day it rained all day, so I didn't do anything city-related. Just sat down
and did some work, grabbed some food and [delicious soup](https://www.facebook.com/levespont).

I will be back in a couple weeks, that is for sure.

The bus ride from Bratislava to Budapest was just 10€, hostel 12€ and I spent
about 12€ for beer and food.

**Costs: 34€**
