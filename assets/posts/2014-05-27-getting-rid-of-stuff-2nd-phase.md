One year ago I was wrapping up the first phase of getting rid of many of my
stuff [to finally get out](/posts/put-yourself-out-there). I haven't
counted how much stuff went for sale, as gifts or in the trash. TV, furniture,
papers, books, electronic equipment, apartment, etc.

One year later my possesions would still fit in one bigger and a normal
backback. Not my BMX bike though. Inspired by the [100 Things
Challange](http://guynameddave.com/about-the-100-thing-challenge/) I sat down
and cataloged which stuff stuck with me and if I can get rid of even more.

My goal isn't exactly to have 100 or less items. There is still some stuff
stashed in the basement of my parents place. This list is more a reflection of
what I have with me while traveling.
