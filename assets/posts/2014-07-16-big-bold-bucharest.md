I left [Sofia](/posts/back-in-sofia) by night-train to Bucharest. I
bought the ticket literally last minute and hopped on the train. Eleven hours
were ahead of me. I didn't even bother to take a sleeping booth because I heard
they are much worse than having a seat for eleven hours.

The landscape in Bulgaria was beautiful. As soon as we entered Romania it was
straight out flat.

At the end of the train ride I met Emma from the UK. We did go for a coffee and
then on the search for the [Antique Hostel](http://www.hostels.com/hostels/bucharest/antique-hostel-bucharest/66935).

Really, never have I've seen such a big, clean and comfortable hostel before. It
has two kitchens, a terrace and a balcony. And the cleanest rooms you have ever
seen. Air conditioning, free breakfast, a friendly staff and whatnot.

Still tired from the train ride I did walk around nearby the hostel. Quikly I
was by the Parliament. HUGE! Actually, I never saw such a huge building.

  civilian building with an administrative function, most expensive administrative
  building and heaviest building

I took a little nap at the nearby park, which was also beautiful.

Only a couple hours in Bucharest, my first impression was beyond positive.
Quickly I extended my stay, from six to ten days.

I called it a day very early and slept for like ten hours straight.

Refreshed I started the next day with a nice breakfast and a bit of work. Not
for too long, since I was pretty eager to see more of Bucharest.

One of the guys from the hostel suggested the [Herăstrău Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her%C4%83str%C4%83u_Park)
to me, which sounded like a good thing to do on a 32°C day.

I walked to the park to see everything in between. For a little break I visited
the [Antipa Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipa_Museum) which was okay.
Wasn't really into the dead stuffed animals, but the butterfly collection was
rather nice.

Finally I arrived the Herăstrău Park. Beautiful! Just like the Parliament, this
place was huge. One of the best city-parks I've ever been to. Chilled there for
a bit until I did go back to the hostel by the metro.

In the evening I met Laurie from Canada. She was that kind of person I do get
along instantly. Very down to earth.

We did go out for dinner and watched the worldcup game that was going on on this
day. Not really sure who played, since I didn't really care for football.

Later that evening I was searching for a party in Bucharest. And surely there
was a good one: [Dub FX](http://dubfx.net/) played at the [Barletto Club & Pool](http://www.feeder.ro/2014/07/04/dub-fx-live-barletto/).
Never saw him live, but I heard good things.

Turned out to be a really good party. The location was pretty kewl, and Dub FX
killed it. At the last song he asked anyone to get down on the floor, and pretty
much everyone in the place did so. Must have been over thousand people. He
started the song with a nice buildup, and when the drop came everybody was
jumping up and partied hard. That was a pretty intense feeling.

One more thing to note here is that the dancefloor was like a gangplank. When
people were dancing it whipped to the beat of the song, or better, to the
majority of people dancing to the beat.

On Saturday I slept a big longer since I was back from the party at seven. This
afternoon I went to the park, both, to chill and to work out a bit.

In the evening I met up with Laurie, Tom, also from Canada and
[Joe](http://www.whereisjoe.co.uk/) from the UK to watch the football game at a
bar. Afterwards we went to the
[Kulturhaus](https://www.facebook.com/kulturhausro) club. It was a okay party.
Crowded and lots of young people.

The next days were like the same as Saturday. Went to the park, chilled out,
worked out. There was also some music, which was pretty nice.

In the evenings I was doing some work. No, seriosly!

On Wednesday I started to record the pitch video for Hostel Hop. Turned out to
be pretty funny, as I usually don't record my self. Some selfies here and there,
but not to that extend. [Here are some scraps from that day](/posts/hostel-hop-pitch-scraps-1).
In the evening I was making the scraps video as well as some other work.

Thursday was take two of the pitch video. Also for the [scraps video](/posts/hostel-hop-pitch-scraps-2).
I wanted to record a video
on a busy intersection, when one guy behind a gate approached me, saying it is
not allowed to stand there. When asked, he told me that I was standing in front
of a government building. Unfortunately I didn't ask him if I could take a
picture with him, as he did look like everything but frightening in his uniform.

Since it was brutally hot the whole day, there was a pretty big thunderstorm in
the evening. I loved it. I can't understand why people are running from the rain
when it's hot as fuck. It's a gift.

Friday I didn't do too much other than catching up on my work. In the evening I
was cooking and sit around with a French-Spanish couple, a guy from South Korea
and one from Taiwan. We drank some wine and talked about this and that. With
such a cultural mix, it's nearly impossible to have a boring conversation.

On Saturday I got up really early, for me that is, even before eight. I went to
the nearby park, did some workout and recorded a Happy Birthday clip for my
friend Nele.

In the afternoon I left this great Hostel to catch the bus to the airport. And
there my plane to Belgrade.

Bye Bucharest. You are officially in the top 5 now. I'll be back!

On a side note: People in Bucharest seems to really like to do the wirework
outside of the buildings. The picture above, for example, is a entrance a metro
station.

The train to from Sofia to Bucharest was 27€. The hostel was 104€ and other
expenses about 85€.

**Costs: 216€**
