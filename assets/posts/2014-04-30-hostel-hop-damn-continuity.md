Ahh, the wonders of continuity. It didn't happen to the [48 days of Hostel
Hop](/posts/hostel-hop-48-days). But why not stick to the project?

That's a question I try to answer to myself for quite a while now. It's not that
I don't have a answer at all, I've found the solution already! But it's some
kind of [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia) dragging me away from
things I should do (stick to the project). Instead I find new projects and other
excuses not to continue. And there are many many many interesting things out
there. Fortunately.

[Structured procrastination](http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/) has
helped me quite a lot. From doing (almost) nothing, to doing many things.

I haven't continued Hostel Hop, but started [Pairs.io](http://pairs.io) (which
is untouched for two weeks now). So, there you have it: unintended progress.

But even I can figure that this is not the way to go to be successful (whatever
that means to you). What is the solution then?

Continuity! Doing work every day. Not procrastinating, not even structured.
Productivity. [Steven
Pressfield](http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/) know it, so do
[Jerry
Seinfeld](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret) and
[John Resig](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/).

I know it! But knowing something is not much worth without applying it. I know
that too. See?!

Hostel Hop will be continued as soon as I get my head out of my ass and finally
take action. Everyday.. whether I feel like it or don't.

Actually, I should start now.
