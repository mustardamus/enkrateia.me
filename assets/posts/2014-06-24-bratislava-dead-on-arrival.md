After my [night in Prague](/posts/a-night-in-prague/) and a quick nap
on the bus I arrived in Bratislava. Never been there before, but my excitement
level was on a low because I was dead from the night before. I longed for a bed.

When I am arrived I was totally unprepared. Well, not totally, I knew that the
[Art Taurus
Hostel](http://www.hostels.com/hostels/bratislava/art-hostel-taurus/51453) was
somewhere near the old town. And that the bus station was somewhat too far away
to walk.

So I thought fuck it, got 50€ from an ATM and took a cab. I already knew
beforehand that this is a bad idea. Why? Because everyone traveling can tell
you that cab drivers waiting in front of train- or bus-stations are ripping off
tourists. Lovely generalization, isn't it? I heard it over and over again.
It never happened to me because I usually like the adventure of taking unknown
public transportations. But since I was dead...

In the end the ride did cost 23€. It's just money, right? And I got dropped off
right in front of the hostel. I also asked the cab driver what 'Thank You' in
slovak means, just to get something more for my money. Well, I forgot it the
second he took off (it's ďakujem).

Check in. Slept from 2PM till 10PM. Got a shower and finally felt like I arrived
in a new city. Hello excitement!

So I went out striving for something to eat in the old town. Naturally I took
slightly the wrong direction (remember, there is no wrong direction in unknown
cities). I ended up on the Dunaj river which gave me the right direction again.

People were out, hanging around, drinking. On the other river side, by the UFO
thingy, was a concert going on. I asked a group of people what was going on over
there and if it's free. 'No idea, have a beer!' was the response. Turned out
they were really friendly dudes and gals, one of them was a street artist. The
second random artist I met in two days.

After a really nice conversation with them I continued to the city and found
food pretty quickly. Although the streets were packed with people (I heard many
many Germans), I did go back to the hostel to get my fair share of sleep.

The next day I went out and did my usual no-goal sightseeing. Bratislava is
pretty nice! The old town is packed with tourists, but the surrounding city
parts are very chilled. I also really enjoyed hanging out in the Horský park and
talking to random people.

In the evening I had dinner with a Brazilian girl I met in the hostel.
Unfortunately I forgot her name. But it was interesting to hear her stand on the
World Cup. She said it's one reason why she is traveling now.

Funnily I went out in the evening to have a beer and partly watched a football
game. Now I am no football guy at all, but seeing tourists from all over the
world going nuts can be pretty funny. Unless there are Germans, then my primary
feeling is shame. Sorry folk(s)!

On the third and last day in Bratislava I did go to the [botanic garden](http://www.uniba.sk/index.php?id=1307).
Pretty chilled. Don't know when
I smelled roses for the last time. After that I trolled around the city a bit
more.

While having dinner at a restaurant I met Laura and Mike from the U.S. Their
kids were playing in a concert in Bratislava. I really enjoy talking with people
from overseas, pointing out the differences as well as the equality.

In the evening I had to catch my bus to Budapest. Now the one million dollar
question: How much did it cost me to get to the bus station? Zero Euro! And it
took only about 10 minutes, while the initial taxi ride was about 20 minutes.
Fuck it.

Just remember, don't take cabs. Especially in front of train- and bus-stations
and if you are not from the area. Unless you are D.O.A.

The hostel was 30€ for two nights, expensive cab ride, food and drinks, going
out was about 60€.

**Costs: 90€**
