I started to work on my project Hostel Hop again. That is, the technical side of
it (more on that in the future).

My plan is to raise some money through crowdfunding. And therefor I need a pitch
video.  And what else could be better to record a pitch video for a traveling
app while travelling?

So yesterday I started to record it. When it's done, it will have many different
places in different cities included, explaining what the app is about.

Until that is done, and I don't know how long it will take, I will release a
scraps video every time I went out and record. I think it's hilarious. Just me
in different places.
