After releasing the source code for my
[Twitter auto-following app](/posts/banned-twitter-auto-follow-application-nodejs)
and my
[winning entry for the Static Showdown Hackathon 2016](/posts/static-showdown-hackathon-piffle-game)
I continue to dig out old projects that were either privatly hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/mustardamus) or catching dust on my backup drives. I
have quite some of them, so expect more in the future.

In 2012 I've attended the [NodeKnockout Hackathon](http://www.nodeknockout.com/)
and coded a Remote Control for Grooveshark which landed me the 3rd place in the
category Utility/Fun.

Motivated by the best place at a Hackathon yet, I coded this concept of a
general purpose remote control for the web. After I've put the first (and only)
version online, I've pursued other things and development stalled.

Now I am releasing the source code (which is over 3 years old in 2016) for
anybody to see, learn from and modify.

Have fun!
