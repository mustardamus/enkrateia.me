### Day 7 - Monday

  meal yesterday (only fruits and donuts)

### Day 10 - Thursday

- Fasting for 16 hours
- Last meal at 6:00pm

### Day 11 - Friday

- Fasting for 19 hours
- Somehow I it's a bit harder today, I wanted to do 21 hours again, but I am
  craving
- Could be because I got a lot of stuff to do, and I need glucose for that
- I probably could go another two hours, but I don't want to
- But it's okay, I set the minimal goal to 18h and I passed it - felxibility!
- Last snack at 00:00am, weed munchies :)
