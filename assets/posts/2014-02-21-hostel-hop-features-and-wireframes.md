### Features for the first version

It's so easy to get lost in ideas and features. There are so many facets to this
project. However, I've been down the road to jump right in development without a
clear vision what comes first. Ultimately, I abolish projects pretty quickly
because I loose interest.
That must not happen with this project. Here are the outlines of features that
the very first version, the alpha, should contain:

  * a user can login with different providers (Twitter, Facebook, etc)
  * a user can login with a username and password combo
  * a user can register a account
  * a user can provide informations about herself
  * a user have a profile page with these information
  * the profile page shows in which hostels the user stayed in
  * the profile page shows friends of the user
  * a user can check-in to a hostel
  * a user can check-out of a hostel
  * a user can become a friend of another user
  * a user can send and receive messages with other users
  * there is a hostel-board with messages posted by users
  * only users checked-in to the hostel can post messages to the hostel-board
  * a list of other people checked-in to the same hostel is shown
  * there is a profile page for hostels
  * with a list of visitors who checked-in in the past
  * the hostel can have a staff, which are users with administrative rights


### Social & Username Login

A user (traveler) can log in to Hostel Hop either via a social account or a
registered account.


### Register a User

A user can register an account instead of logging in via another social website.


### User Homepage

Once logged in, a user see the menu to the left. On the homepage, if she is
checked in a hostel, the user can see the *hostel board*. These are messages
written by users who either were or are in the hostel.
There is also a overview of checked-in users.


### Profile Settings

Basic information about a user. These informations are displayed on the user
profile.


### Messages Overview

People can send and receive messages. This is the overview of all messages.


### Messages with another User

Overview of messages written with another user. It also shows you in which
hostel you met the other user.


### User Profile

This is what other people see when visiting your profile. Your basic information
like interests. It displays your friends and also in which hostels you were
before.


### Hostel Homepage

This is the what people see when they are visiting a hostel page. All the
visitors that have ever checked-in to the hostel.
The location as well as the staff (user with administrative rights) working in
the hostel.

A logged in user has the ability to check in to the hostel. A user can only be
checked in one hostel at a time.

*There will be more information shown on the hostel page, like events. Not in
the first version though.*
