_tl;dr I've procrastinated two months on translating (I keep notes in German)
and finishing this post. Anyway, I've had a blast in Budapest, just like last
year. Many Drum and Bass parties, I met many awesome people and basically had a
care-free time. I'll be back, for sure._

At first I wasn't really keen to take the overnight train from
[Belgrade](/posts/break-in-in-belgrade) to Budapest. But as it
turned out, it was a really nice train.

The first hour or two I talked to two guys from Serbia. They gave me some meat,
which was delicious. Not sure what exactly it was, but delicious for sure. All I
could offer in return were some pistachios.

I arrived at Budapest very early in the morning. Since I have spent one month
here, last year, I very well knew my way to the
[Bubble Hostel](http://www.hostels.com/hostels/budapest/budapest-bubble/20989).
I am afraid I woke up Anna to let me in. She gave me a temporary bed in the staff
room and I went straight to sleep for a couple hours.

After I woke up I did some work, since the hostel was empty. But it didn't took
too long until I met the first two guys from India. They invited me to a joint and
to join them for a
'[escape game](http://www.lockedescape.hu/main.html)'. You basically have to
solve puzzles to get out of an apartment. Sounded like fun, but in the end it
sucked. It's more a tourist trap. And they charged 10.000 Forint (about 30€)!
Anyway, hang out for a bit with kewl people. Successful first afternoon.

In the evening we sat down in the bitsy hostel common room and played
drinking games. Usually people from the US kick that off. Also included were the
two Indian guys, three English guys, and well, me.

Later I met Olga again. One of the owners of the hostel and a generously nice
person. She took us all out to go to some ruin bars. At first we did go to
[Fogas Ház](https://www.facebook.com/fogashaz). There I drank my first
[Pálinka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1linka) since a long time. I love
that stuff. Sometimes very tasty, at other times it knocks you out of your socks.

After that we went to [Instant](https://www.facebook.com/instant.art.bar.wood).
Or should I say to the sauna? It was so hot down
in the basement where you could dance. And surprise, Drum and Bass was on! Since
I already felt happy because I was again in Budapest, and because of the
Pálinka, I let loose and put out some moves. After a minute I was completely
wet.

With all that energy radiating from me I met quite a bunch of people. For a
example, one guy who had 'Shit Happens' tattooed on his ass. Hero for the night.

I also met Alice from Scotland and we destroyed the dance floor when Dubstep was
playing. I can remember really funny moves.

Perfect first day in Budapest!

Next day I took it pretty easy. Did some work, as well as my laundry. The guy
who manages the laundry/internet cafe did remember me. Pretty impressive, after
one year and thousands of tourists doing their laundry.

Eventually my old friend Gene popped in to the Bubble. He knew I was coming to
Budapest, but not when. So it was a great surprise to see each other again. It
was great catching up. He is still living in Budapest, but stopped working at
the Bubble. Currently he is chilling with his Hungarian girlfriend, fishing and
keeping it simple. Great dude.

Afterwards I met up with Dominique, the Canadian girl I first met in
[Belgrade](/posts/break-in-in-belgrade).
She, Mauricio from Brazil and myself went to [Margaret
Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Island). Beautiful place. Can't
believe I haven't been there once at my last stay in Budapest. There is a
fountain which is synced to music. We stand at least 15 minutes in front of it
and enjoyed the show.

After that we did go to dinner with some more people from the hostel. In the
night we visited the new rooftop bar
[360](http://www.funzine.hu/venues/360-bar/). The bouncers let us wait 20
minutes before we all could go up there, but in the end it was pretty
impressive. Not worth waiting for it, but still impressive.

I ended up at Instant again. Aka the sauna. Naturally, I've found a Drum and
Bass party again. Pretty good training for the Let it Roll festival.

The saturday was extremely hot. So I took that as excuse to do some work. Sounds
strange. But yeah, I had to catch up some work (like most of the time when I am
on the road).

In the evening everybody at the hostel was drinking and left for a pool-party. I
wasn't interested, so I was chilling for a bit alone in the hostel and did some
more work.

But it wasn't long until Gene and Gabor, the other owner of the hostel, came
in. We had some drinks together and talked about this and that. A little bit
later two American guys also came back from the city.

Together with them I went to [Corvintető](http://corvinteto.hu/) for a eight
hour DJ set. It was really good! I was expecting a little bit more drum and
bass, but the progressive house was really good. I danced until the lights were
turned on.

After the party some people were chilling in front of the place. I was asking
one dude for a cigarette. He mustered me and asked "Where are you from?". After
telling him that I am from Germany he got really aggressive, without an obvious
reason. After some arguments it turned out that he thought I was lying on being
a German. I offered him to show my ID, but only if he finally shuts up. Done
that, and he turned from the angry dude into a nice man. He even practiced his
German skills on me. And of course, handed me a cig.

After some quick chit-chat with him and his girlfriend I sayed goodbye. He gave
me five (!) cigarettes. I was turning it down, but he insisted. Well, I smoked one
and gave the other four to random people on the street the way back to the
hostel.

Next day, Sunday, I took it easy again and didn't go out. Instead, after some
work, I started to play around with [Tinder](http://www.gotinder.com/). I've
heard about it before, but actually never used it. After hearing a couple of guys
in the hostel talking about it, I thought I'd give it a shot.

The next day I had the first chat with a couple of girls. And in the evening I
met with Kata. In the beginning it was quite awkward, but it developed to a
pretty good conversation about life and taking chances.

After we said goodbye, I did go back to the hostel to meet with the other people
and we did go to [Kolor](https://www.facebook.com/kolorprojekt). Quite okay, but
I ended up at Instant again. And again, after most of the tourists were gone, it
was an excellent Drum and Bass session. The locals really know how to rave to
this kind of music. Good vibes.

In the morning I had the kind of breakfast I wanted to avoid. Kebab. Randomly
two English guys asked me if I want a Kebab which was intended for a friend of
theirs who got missing in the process of ordering. Why not? A little chit-chat
in the morning and a free Kebab. Works for me.

On Tuesday it finally rained and I took another day 'off' from partying. Stayed
in the hostel, chatted with people and did some work.

Wednesday I finally went out and recorded the [next clips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzoFNw-oU8g)
for the Hostel Hop pitch video. I did go to Margaret Island and shoot a clip by
the river and one in the park.

In the evening I met Kata again, we walked by the river, which is a great thing
to do when it's dark, because most old buildings and bridges are lit up.

I came back to the Hostel at midnight, and everyone was already gone. So I used
the quite moment and did my daily work for like three hours. At three in the
morning I decided to give Instant just another shot. Maybe I'll be lucky again.

When I arrived at Instant it was packed. Anyway, that only meant I can make some
quick connections with strangers from all over the world. After a hour of
Dubstep (not really a fan) it got better and the DJs started to play Jungle. Oh
yeah, it ended in a sweet Drum and Bass session again.

In the past year I really learned to love and appreciate this kind of music. I
could do it everyday, that is mentally, definitely not physically. So I stayed
until the lights were turned on, and called it a successful day.

Thursday, (does it matter what day it was anyway?) I felt pretty much destroyed
from the day before and didn't want to go out again. In the afternoon I worked,
hang out in the hostel and went up the Gellért Hill to chill some more and read
a book. Very nice place to relax for a bit and chat up some tourists.

In the evening I was looking forward to continue the day with relaxing and
chilling. But then Paola from Chile, I met her in Belgrade, messaged me that she
is in Budapest. Only one day. Since she is really kewl, I surely wanted to see
her again. It was her first time in Budapest, so I showed her around a bit. We went to
four ruin-pubs, finished of with dancing until the morning.

Next day finally was my day off. Worked for a bit, lived hostel life and did go
to bed quite early.

And there it was again, a weekend in Budapest. On Saturday I've continued to
[record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1FriTmNCnc) for the pitch video
(which is probably still "in the making" when you read this).

Most people who stayed in the Hostel to this time went to the pool party. I,
again, didn't want to go.

So I was chilling with Gene, and later two Danish guys and Luka from the US in
the Hostel, drinking a bit and chatting. At like three in the morning I
suggested to go to Instant. Surprisingly all the other guys came along.

Unfortunately Instant wasn't too good that Saturday. No Drum 'n Bass, a lot of
drunk tourists. So we continued to drink some Pálinka, Gene and the Danish
guys eventually left.

Me and Luka stayed until the lights went on and continued in a little Bar across
the street. I don't know which Muse whispered in my drunk ear, but I suddenly
started to ask people for Heroin. Not because I wanted it, but to fuck
with people (what I do way too sparsely). I can't really write about all the
things that happened, partly because I forgot them, but it was the start of a
super fun morning.

In the bar I got in a conversation with an American and we got to the topic NSA
and surveillance. For the first time I heard somebody say that this is ok, or
even good. His argumentation was the same you would hear from the US Government.
It needs to be done to chase Terrorists effectively. And since the US are the
'good guys', it's ok to play word-police and spy on basically everyone connected
to the internet. It was a very heated, Pálinka fueled, conversation. But
respectful. In the end, none of us have changed our opinions, but we got
smarter and saw it from a different angle. He even paid for a round of beer.

After the bar, the sun has been up for hours, we started our way back to the
hostel. On the way we got another beer and basically fucked with every person
that came across us. Most of the time they were amused.

We almost made it back to the Hostel, but none of us wanted to cut off the
awesome times. So we tried to get a free ride with the subway (in Budapest
you have to pass through ticket inspectors to get in). And it worked! I just
asked the dude who was standing in front of the elevator, and he let us pass.

Once we were further away from the Hostel again, we could have some more fun on
the way back home. And more beer. More interactions with random people. Some
would call that 'god mode'. I really felt I could approach anyone, which is
definitely not my default.

We were back at the Hostel at about 11am.

Cause and effect: The next day was horrible. I haven't been that hung-over for
a very long time. I got out of bed, cooked some Spaghetti, ate, and chilled
myself back in bed. Watched a movie. That was it. A glory Sunday.

On Monday I was back on track. Got up at 10am, worked a bit and recorded more
pitch-video-snippets.

On Tuesday there was the usual party madness. Not as hard as Saturday, but still
awesome.

On Wednesday I had the chance to check out the [Prezi](http://prezi.com/) office
(building) here in Budapest. By chance I met Sean, who is working there, a week
before. His friends from the States stayed at the Bubble Hostel and he joined
us one evening going out.

Man! That's one impressive work place. Awesome old house in the middle of
Budapest, huge team, nice flair, free food and drinks. Sean showed me around and
told me a bit about Prezi and how it is to work for them.

For a long time I want to live in Budapest for a couple of months (at least).
When this becomes true, I definitely apply for a job there. They even have
open positions. But that's the future.

Thursday was my last evening in Budapest, and I couldn't really do anything
since my bus to Prague (which I missed) was scheduled very early Friday morning.

Anyway, there is no reason to be sad because I definitely will be back to
Budapest. It is still my favorite city. If you haven't been there, and got a
chance to go, do it!

I got some discount on the Hostel and had to pay 293€ for almost a month
(Thanks Olga!). The train from Belgrade to Budapest was just 24€. For food,
drinks and excessive partying I've spent roughly 300€.

Costs: **617€**
