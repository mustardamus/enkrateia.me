For the past seven months I've been homeless. Stop the tears right now because I
love it. It was intentional.

But lets go back a little. I've always wanted to travel and see the world. But I
couldn't get started. The main reasons for this was my
[procrastination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastination) and the wrong
idea how I should travel. I've had the picture of a world tour in my head. So I
needed quite some money to get off. And because I was procrastinating instead of
taking action, this didn't happened.

In 2012 I was living with my (ex)girlfriend in Berlin. In the middle of the year
I found out about procrastination. Never heard of that before, but it described
my style of living and doing things perfectly. Finally I knew what's 'wrong'
with me and I could work on it.

With retrospect on missed opportunities, sabotaged relationships and
self-sabotage after all I was pretty unhappy. My girlfriend back than saw
'procrastination' as an excuse for me to be a lazy ass. Other people as well.

And yeah, I was a lazy ass. Because I idled on the status quo. But now that I
knew it: time for some change!

At the end of the year I left Berlin and also my girlfriend. The plan was just
to clear of everything that would stand in the way of hunting my dreams. And it
wouldn't stop there.

After six months living in my hometown and having fun with my old friends I quit
my apartment. On my 26th birthday I had to move out. I got rid of most of my
belongings. Furniture, gone. TV, gone. Bed, gone. Everything you can think of.

I'd say my family and friends were rather skeptical about this radical approach
of forcing myself out of my ordinary life.

Next I found myself for one month in Prague. And I loved it! Everyday I had new
experiences. I tried out new things. There was no status quo anymore.

[More cities followed](/travel): Amsterdam, Rotterdam,
Brussels, Brugge, Budapest and Copenhagen.

Now, seven months later sitting in a hostel in Sofia, I can say that this was
one of the best decisions of my life.

Not only I've made my dream of traveling become true, I've also grew so much
personally. And this must be the best reward for taking such action of leaving
everything behind.

The bottom line is, if you are unhappy you have to tweak things. And if you
can't do it with your own motivation, force yourself. *Step outside of your
comfort zone* or however you want to call it. But start!
