It's my 9862. day on earth. It's my 27th birthday, and I don't really care. At
first, this sounds negative, but let me explain.

When I was younger, I really cared for the past as well as the future, thus
birthdays were kinda exciting and special. These days I could be happy and proud
of myself, because I was still alive. I had a reason to celebrate!

It was about two years ago when I began this journey to reinvent myself. I
realized that critically dissecting the past and worrying about the future did
nothing good for me. I was living in a shell, scared to come out.

Somewhere along the line I stopped caring what has and what will happen to me,
and started to care for the only time we actually have: the moment.

I love being alive, and it doesn't need to be my birthday to realize that
anymore. In my opinion you should try and celebrate every day like it's your
birthday. Of course, it will not work everyday. But we have to try at least.

It's not that I doom birthdays in general. If people feel specially happy about
it, I am happy for them too. You have to figure it out for yourself.

For me every day is a special day.
