### [Pairs.io](http://pairs.io) - *not available anymore*

#### Website

Completely redone. I stick with the one-pager but make it scrollable. The site
is mainly build around the demo, which is a slideshow, with additional info to
be found when scrolling down.

#### Demo

Slightly extended. In the last demo there was only a one way communication, from
the remote to the desktop. Now it's two ways, update the slide on the remote and
sending commands from it.

#### *Update*

I discontinued working on Pairs.io but decided to make it open-source for you
to play with: [Pairs.io @ GitHub](https://github.com/mustardamus/pairs).

Have fun.
