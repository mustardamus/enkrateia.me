Over a year ago I got rid of my TV ([along with many other stuff](http://akrasia.me/getting-rid-of-stuff-second-phase/)).
Ever since, I
rarely watch TV and no News at all. Which was a pretty smart move for me, in my
opinion. TV is for entertainment and programming of the masses. The so called
'mainstream media'.

Today I take the next step, and (try to) ban **every** News. I don't want to see
it anymore! Not the mainstream propaganda bullshit, nor the rants against it.

Although I tried to figure out good sources of news, I felt more and more to be
like in a vortex. Even if you don't watch the mainstream propaganda (about
Ukraine and Russia, comes to mind) it will eventually get stuffed in your face
day in and day out.

In the end, I feel bad about it anyway. No matter where the information is
coming from or what its intention is (for propaganda or to inform). World War III
is on the door step? 1984 is already here? Why spent I more time thinking about
these things instead of the joyful things? It's because we hear and see it every
single day.

Don't get me wrong, this is not a resignation! I still care deeply about topics
like freedom, peace and happiness. And I am against Governments pushing for war,
and three letter agencies fucking up your privacy and the whole internet for
that matter.

I want to take a step back. I don't want details anymore. I want the bigger
picture. If something super important is going on, it will find your eyes and
ears anyway in this connected world.

So starting from today, I will ban every sources of News where I can:

- I unsubscribe from feeds in my RSS reader
- I unsubscribe from YouTube channels
- I block News-Sites I used to visit (and redirect to this blog instead)
- Hide all Facebook posts in the feed (I use Facebook to connect & message only
  anyway.. just in case the first posts in the feed catch my attention)
- I let people know that I got rid of News if they want to discuss the latest
  developments, and talk about the bigger picture instead

I feel like leaving the theater.
