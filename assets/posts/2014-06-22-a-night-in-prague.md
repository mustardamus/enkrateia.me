After five months in Leipzig I'm finally back on the road. I documented my trip
last year [only by pictures](/travel). While it's true
that they are saying more than thousand words, this time I want to share a bit
more. What I do, how I travel, how much I spent and who I met. Lets get started!

### Leipzig ⇢ Dresden ⇢ _Prague_

Ah, [Prague](/travel#Prague). My last
trip also started there and I spent one whole month. It must be my 8th time in
Prague. It's fair to say that I know the city. Not only is it nice for touristy
stuff, but I really like the nightlife and people there.

This time I only spent one night to go to a [Drum and Bass party](http://www.crossclub.cz/cs/program/3224-imperialistic-night-cechy-a-morava-united-prihlaseni-na-udalost-na-fb-jako-zucastnim-se-zdarma-free/)
in the infamous [Cross Club](http://www.crossclub.cz/en/contact/).

The DnB party was pretty good, I danced a lot and so do my legs feel today. A
must after a bomb party.

At the end of the party I met Martina. She happens to be a really kewl artist,
re-assembling stuff she finds everywhere into (sometimes weird) art. I had two
hours left until I had to catch my bus to Bratislava. So we had coffee together
and talked about having no home, traveling and life in general.

Time elapsed pretty fast and I finally was on my bus to Bratislava. I was done,
I did sleep for the three hour journey straight. Traveling in a half-delirium is
pretty damn easy and fun, if you ask me.

Traveling by bus from Leipzig to Prague is just 27€. Going out is about 3€, add
some drinks and food for about 10€.

**Costs: 40€**
