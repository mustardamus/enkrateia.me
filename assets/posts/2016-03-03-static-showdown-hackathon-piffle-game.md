For the past 5 years I attend remote hackathons, namely
[Rails Rumble](http://railsrumble.com/),
[Node Knockout](http://www.nodeknockout.com/) and
[Static Showdown](https://staticshowdown.com/). It's fun, it's challenging, and
it's good for learning new technologies.

A couple of weeks ago the Static Showdown 2016 were held, a hackathon where you
have 48 hours to build an static app.

For quite a while I had an idea about a little game that is played with your
voice, which includes silence detection and speech recognition. Static Showdown
was a good opportunity to build it, since it only requires browser technology
and no back-end.

This time I wasn't really pumped up about the hackathon, or had any goals in
mind. I just wanted to see how far I can go. And with that easy mind I was able
to build the best hackathon entry yet, the most finished an polished.

And it paid! After my 3rd place at Node Knockout in 2012 I set a new record for
myself and scored 2nd place at Static Showdown!

**Update:** The organizers did let me know that I also had the best solo score.
Pretty gnarly! There is the first place :).

Now I want to share the code of the game with you.

It's mainly a [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) application. Without Vue.js, I
probably wouldn't come that far.

Another new thing I used for the first time, and probably continue to use, is
the [Bulma CSS Framework](http://bulma.io/).

The code has some known bugs. And it's totally messy. In short, it looks like
it was written in 48 hours :). But I hope you have fun trying it out and maybe
learn a thing or two from it.
